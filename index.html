            <img src="img/elevate_map.png" alt="Elevate Map" class="map"> 

            <p>The game we will be playing is called "Elevate". It is a game where two teams of two robots each compete. There are two phases in the game, autonomous and driver control. In autonomous, the goal is to cross the baseline, and to release the balls from the Auto Loader. In driver, the goal is to score balls into each team's own goals. Additionally, points are earned for each robot that hangs from the Elevate Bar by the end of the game.</p>

        <div id="strategy">
            <h2 class="Title">Strategy</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Have one robot stay at the manual loading station to constantly shoot balls, while the other robot collects balls for the shooting robot, or shoot the balls they picked up</li>
                <li>Using a lift system to score balls is inefficient because of the 5 ball limit, since it would take a long time to load just 5 balls.</li>
                <li>If balls are shot fast enough, only one robot should elevate while the other gets more points, because a ranking point is awarded even if only one robot elevates, as long as 5 balls are released during autonomous</li>
                <li>To avoid building a separate loading system for the auto loader, we should design a mechanism to drop the auto loader balls into the loading station for manual loading</li>
                <li>Minimize the time wasted when transferring balls from the loading station and the human feeder with a bucket to put the balls in</li>

                        I made some design decisions like keeping the base light so itd be easier to lift. After a bit, I decided on what it was going to be like and i started making the frame of the base.

                    We fixed the launching system, using a gear ratio to increase the speed of the launcher. We also changed to blue motors, which has a higher rpm. The gears can be seen under the wheels.

                    I redid the wiring to make the robot look nicer and to make it easier to work on the robot. I also redid the port configuration because the old one did not make sense. Below is a diagram with the ports.

                    Competition day! We did pretty well, but we had some issues with the robot. We had to fix the robot a few times, but we managed to get it working again. We got Champion, but our autoloader balls failed once. We fixed the centerline cross during the tournament though. We also failed inspection, because the bar we used to release the balls was too long, and our claw was too tall.

                    Our elevate system broke off the rest of the robot so we had to fix that. We tried to reattach it in different ways but realized there were other parts of the robot in the way, so we had to take a decent bit apart to reattach the parts we wanted to

                    We participated in the competition at Enver Creek! We ended up doing pretty well, getting into semifinals. However, here are some issues we had:
                    <ul>
                        <li>One of our drive wheels came loose</li>
                        <li>Our autonomous often failed</li>
                        <li>Our shooting system was not accurate enough to be useful</li>
                        <li>For the first half, our elevate system was too short. We fixed this during the competition.</li>
                    </ul>

                    We'll be working on fixing these issues for the next competition in January.

                    Today, Nathan, James, and I removed the shooting system, because we decided to use an elevator system rather than a shooting one. This is because at the competition we noticed the robots that performed well were the ones who lifted the balls into the goal rather than shooting it, because shooting systems were not accurate enough. We also redid some of the wheels, and they should not fall off anymore. Thirdly, we discussed how to build the scoring system, which they partially built.

This will require us to travel back and forth between the human feeder and goal, but it should be much more accurate.
