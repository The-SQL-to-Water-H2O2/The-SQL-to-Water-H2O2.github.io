            <img src="img/elevate_map.png" alt="Elevate Map" class="map"> 

            <p>The game we will be playing is called "Elevate". It is a game where two teams of two robots each compete. There are two phases in the game, autonomous and driver control. In autonomous, the goal is to cross the baseline, and to release the balls from the Auto Loader. In driver, the goal is to score balls into each team's own goals. Additionally, points are earned for each robot that hangs from the Elevate Bar by the end of the game.</p>

        <div id="strategy">
            <h2 class="Title">Strategy</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Have one robot stay at the manual loading station to constantly shoot balls, while the other robot collects balls for the shooting robot, or shoot the balls they picked up</li>
                <li>Using a lift system to score balls is inefficient because of the 5 ball limit, since it would take a long time to load just 5 balls.</li>
                <li>If balls are shot fast enough, only one robot should elevate while the other gets more points, because a ranking point is awarded even if only one robot elevates, as long as 5 balls are released during autonomous</li>
                <li>To avoid building a separate loading system for the auto loader, we should design a mechanism to drop the auto loader balls into the loading station for manual loading</li>
                <li>Minimize the time wasted when transferring balls from the loading station and the human feeder with a bucket to put the balls in</li>

                        I made some design decisions like keeping the base light so itd be easier to lift. After a bit, I decided on what it was going to be like and i started making the frame of the base.

                    I worked on the launching system with Amitoj, but the system is not strong enough. We will prioritize making the launching system stronger.

                    This week was full of me just building a bunch of our ideas, including a launch system, a funnel, and figuring out how to attack things properly.

                    I literally did everything by myself while my team did nothing and didn't ask to help. its hard being so dedicated to this robot. /s

                    We fixed the launching system, using a gear ratio to increase the speed of the launcher. We also changed to blue motors, which has a higher rpm. The gears can be seen under the wheels.

                    I made last minute changes to the robot during lunch, including improving the loading system by adding a ramp for the ball to roll on instead of relying on luck to load balls.

                    Added some last minute with Alex at lunch. I got some pieces and made a system and he refined everything we had.

                    I redid the wiring to make the robot look nicer and to make it easier to work on the robot. I also redid the port configuration because the old one did not make sense. Below is a diagram with the ports.
